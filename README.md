# ðŸŽ§ Spotify Artist Comparison

Compare the top tracks and audio features of your favorite artists using real Spotify data.

### ðŸ§  Project Summary

This app fetches the top 10 tracks for:

- **Kendrick Lamar**
- **Drake**
- **J. Cole**

Then extracts and compares:
- ðŸŽµ Track Name

It creates a `CSV` file of the results and displays an interactive **bar chart dashboard** using Streamlit.
